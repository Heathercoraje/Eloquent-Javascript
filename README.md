Eloquent Javascript: A modern introduction to programming

As one of legendary introductory books on Javascript, Eloquent Javascript provides a kind explanation with sets of exercises as well as several projects in last chapters. I am using this repo to add some interesting codes on exercises and also to add a link to a working log of [#100DaysofCode Challenge](https://github.com/Heathercoraje/100-days-of-code)
